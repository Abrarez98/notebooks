It is the start of a data processing scheme that brings insight into field state and operational planning.\n\nLet us begin by importing some useful libraries that will be used throughout the notebook. Those are:\n1. requests: Makes HTTP requests. We will use it to grab data from ACIS.\n2. pandas: A popular tool for doing data analysis in python. We will use it for just about everything :).\n3. matplotlib: A tool for making graphical plots. We will use it to, well, make plots!\n\n_Note:_ I set the matplotlib style to “seaborn” because I like it better.
